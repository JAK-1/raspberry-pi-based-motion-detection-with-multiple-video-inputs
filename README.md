# raspberry-pi-based-motion-detection-with-multiple-video-inputs

this will help you to have multiple video inputs and detect motion on individual streams

usage:

home security
you have a camera in each room. A typical camera would just record, but this setup will automatically fire an alert as soon as it senses a movement.

The two streams are different. There will be an option to merge the stream and make it one in a new update.
